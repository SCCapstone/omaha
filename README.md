# Project Omaha #

> Voting is the most precious right of every citizen, and we have a moral obligation to ensure the integrity of our voting process. &mdash;Hillary Clinton

**Project Omaha** is a University of South Carolina Capstone Computing Project and a collaboration between [Philip Conrad][philip-conrad], [Zac Hughes][zac-hughes], [Xander Jordan][xander-jordan], and [Myndert Papenhuyzen][myndert-papenhuyzen], students of the University under the auspices of Dr. Duncan Buell. This project is tasked with analyzing the iVotronic&reg; Direct-Recording Electronic (DRE) voting machine developed by [Electronic Systems & Software, LLC](http://essvote.com), which is the technology used for electronic voting in the state of South Carolina.

## What's included

 - `docs/` :: Documentation and research papers about the iVotronic.
 - `ivo/` :: Datasheets and code for the iVotronic voting machine.
 - `peb/` :: Datasheets and code for the Portable Electronic Ballot units used with the iVotronic.


## Project highlights

 - JTAG program flashing code from a 1995 i386EX JTAG manual.
 - A bona-fide hex dump from the PEBs. It shows that code protection is enabled, meaning no useful data can be recovered from the chip without serious hardware hacking.
