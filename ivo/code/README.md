 * `taploadr-old.cpp` is transcribed from Appendix A in the i386EX JTAG manual.
    It was intended to allow the user to flash code over to an i386EX standard 
    evaluation board. The core parts should be applicable to our work.
 * `TAPLOADR.CPP` is the straight-from-Intel code.
 * `README.TXT` is the README from Intel, explaining how to use TAPLOADR.
 * `TAPLOADR.EXE` is a program intended to be run on the i386EX EV386EX 
    Evaluation Board, to program its onboard flash.
